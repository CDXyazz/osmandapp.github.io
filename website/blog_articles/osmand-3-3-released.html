<div class="date">March 7, 2019</div>
<p>OsmAnd 3.3 has been released! We're glad to share all the improvements so let's get started.</p>
<p>We follow our <a href="https://osmand.net/help-online/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> adn now we completely <b>removed Facebook and Firebase analytics from the free version (OsmAnd+ doesn't include it)</b>.</p>
<h3>Navigation on public transport: Metro, Buses, Tram and so on.</h3>
<p>At first we start from  the Navigation on public transport. This feature has beta version. Each of you can try to navigate at your city by public transport now with OsmAnd. We want to receive your feedback for customization of this feature. And the general we use for building navigation on public transport the New Public Transport Schema has been called Public Transport Version 2 (PTv2). You can check your public transport <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/">here</a>. How to build or correct public transport routes we will describe in our blog soon.</p>

<h3>Improve Quick action</h3>
<p>As requested by many users, we have added Show/Hide tracks, Day/Night mode switches in Quick action. Quick action is a flexible menu of shortcuts providing direct access to whatever features you need to access most frequently: You select and add them to this 'toolbar'. In this way, the next time you need to add a new favorite, add a navigation destination, enable or disable voice guidance, etc. The quick action button can be added via the Configure screen menu. To add actions to the menu, please press 'Add action' right on its menu bar. To remove an action, go to Configure screen and tap the 'Quick action' menu, then remove any shortcuts not needed.</p>

<h3>Additional info in the Route details.</h3>
<p>While building a route,  you can view information about the road itself like road types, surface, steepness and smoothness. It will help you in understanding the road conditions of your route.</p>
