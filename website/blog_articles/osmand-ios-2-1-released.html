<h1>OsmAnd 2.1 (iOS)</h1>
<div class="date">April 10, 2018</div>
<p>OsmAnd 2.1 is now available! The release includes many highly-requested features including UI updates and significant improvements in navigation. So let's get to the details!
</p>
<h3>New context menu</h3>
<p>The context menu of a point has been updated to a new convenient design. Also, it now shows Wikipedia articles about the nearby objects. A great feature for travelers.</p>
<h3>Intermediate waypoints</h3>
<p>Navigation routes became the number one feature of the last release. This time, we're adding the ability to add intermediate waypoints along the route. Now you can plan your entire route for the day at once instead of making a new one after every stop.</p>
<h3>Faster route calculation</h3>
<p>As a complementary enhancement to the previous feature, we made sure the routes are calculated faster. So even if you're planning a long trip, your route engine will keep up.</p>
<p>We also fixed some issues including the one with sudden termination upon launch.</p>
<p>We hope you find the new version convenient and helpful!
