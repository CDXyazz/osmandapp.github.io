<div class="date">April 10, 2018</div>
<p>OsmAnd 2.1 is now available! The release includes many highly-requested features including UI updates and significant improvements in navigation. So let's get to the details!
</p>
<h3>New context menu</h3>
<p>The context menu of a point has been updated to a new convenient design. Also, it now shows Wikipedia articles about the nearby objects. A great feature for travelers.</p>

<h3>Intermediate waypoints</h3>
<p>Navigation routes became the number one feature of the last release. This time, we're adding the ability to add intermediate waypoints along the route. Now you can plan your entire route for the day at once instead of making a new one after every stop.</p>
<h3>Faster route calculation</h3>
<p>As a complementary enhancement to the previous feature, we made sure the routes are calculated faster. So even if you're planning a long trip, your route engine will keep up.</p>

<h3>Navigation features</h3>
<p>We added several updates related to navigation. First, OsmAnd now offers the widget that shows you an optimal lane for your current position on the route. The app also shows you important alarms: speed limit. etc., in the lower-left corner of the map screen.</p>

<p>Also, the new version of OsmAnd helps you avoid certain roads during navigation. You may know that there's bad road quality or that road is stuck in traffic at the moment. Select to avoid that road by pressing the settings button in the navigation context menu and going to Avoid roads > Select on map. Then tap on the street you'd like to avoid. To stop avoiding that street, please press on the road works sign and choose 'Dismiss'.</p>
<h3>POI along route</h3>
<p>Finally, you can view POI along your route by pressing the 'flag' button in the navigation context menu.</p>
<h3>Route simulation</h3>

</div>
<p>A great feature for developers or anyone who wants to test their future route: you can now simulate your position and view the navigation as if you're in a certain location, even though your actual location can be quite different. To try the feature, please calculate a route, then go to its settings in the context menu and select Navigation Settings > 'Simulate your position'. Then press 'Go' to start navigation as usual.</p>
<h3>Contour lines color</h3>
<p>Using contour lines for hiking or just to get information about the area? Select the color that is convenient to you in Map > Contour lines color scheme.</p>
<p>We also fixed some issues including the one with sudden termination upon launch.</p>
<p>We hope you find the new version convenient and helpful!
