<h2>Routeinfo - full information about your trip.</h2>
<div class="date">October 23, 2019</div>
<p>After the route is built, you can press the "Details" button, which hides the additional graphs. In the 3.4.2 release, there are Road types, Surface, Smoothness, Steepness, Surface firmness (Tracktype), Winter, and ice roads available. The graphs are interactive and synchronized with one another and the route overview map.</p>


<p>
When you click on the graph, the cursor is displayed where you tap, and in the legend below the current chart element is highlighted in bold. You can also zoom in on the part of the graph using the pinch/pinch gesture. In this case, the other graphs will also change the display boundaries.	
</p>

<p>
On the overview map of the route, which is located at the very top of the screen, the scale will be changed so that the entire section of the path displayed on the graphs is currently displayed.
</p>

<p>
If the graphic does not contain any data, it is not displayed.
</p>

<p>
You can set your custom graphics by <a href="https://osmand.net/help/docs/Custom_Rendering_How-To.html">editing the map style</a>. Graphics settings are dependant on the map style. For example, Surface graphic displays different colors of OsmAnd (default) and Topo map styles.	
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of a style that depends on the standard OsmAnd style and adds a street lighting scheme:
