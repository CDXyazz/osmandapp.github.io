<h1>OsmAnd 2.4</h1>
<div class="date">August 8, 2016</div>
<p>OsmAnd update is here. We've introduced a new search interface and many fixes. Read on to find out all the details.</p>
<h4>New quick search</h4>
<p>A quick search was probably one of the most requested features the team has been receiving. Its first version is included into OsmAnd 2.4. Now, you can enter almost any type of query, be it a type of POI, an address or even a link to the map and find it using the Search button on the map screen. We kept the regular search in the main menu to help users transition comfortably from the more traditional search to the new one.</p>

<h4>Car audio system integration</h4>
<p>Now OsmAnd can be integrated into your car navigation system.Connect the Android device running OsmAnd via Bluetooth to a car stereo system which provides speakerphone functionality. If in OsmAnd you select Settings - General Settings - Voice guidance output - Phone call audio, OsmAnd will interrupt any music to play its navigation prompts.</p>

<h4>Helpful transport information</h4>
<p>In the previous OsmAnd release, we introduced the transport stops information. In 2.4, this has been developed even more. Now, you can turn them on in Configure map - Transport - Transport stops, then tap on one and see all the routes on that stop. More to come, you can tap a route to view it on the map from start to end.</p>

<p>We reworked route guidance, voice prompting, and added new turn lane indication. The release also includes numerous fixes like improved storage management, etc. Besides that, some local languages like Sorbian have been added to the new release. You can find them in Settings - General - Display language.</p>
