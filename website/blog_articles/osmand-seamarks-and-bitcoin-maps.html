<div class="date">July 17, 2014</div>
<p>New maps are available to download <a href="http://download.osmand.net/download.php?standard=yes&file=World_bitcoin_payments_2.obf.zip">World bitcoin payments</a> and <a href="http://download.osmand.net/download.php?standard=yes&file=World_seamarks_2.obf.zip">World seamarks</a>. </p>
<p>In order to see all places where you could pay bitcoins in bitcoins present in OpenStreetMap, you could use 'POI Layer' or 'Search POI' in category Finance. You can also use search by name in order to find all places. Since OsmAnd 1.7 : new sub category "bitcoin" is present in the category "Finance". </p>
<p>Seamarks is POI layer of OpenSeaMap, which later will be transformed into a special rendering map style. </p>
<p>Maps will be updated on the regularly schedule.</p>
