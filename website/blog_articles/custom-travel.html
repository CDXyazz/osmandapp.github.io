<div class="date">June 26, 2018</div>

<h3>Prepare the files</h3>
<p>The GPX tracks can be downloaded from the internet or you can create one (using OsmAnd or any online GPX creation tool).</p>
<p>To start, please prepare your files. Save your track with '.GPX' extension and the text file as '.html'. In order to create your custom database successfully, the names of the GPX file and the html have to be identical. For example, 'Milan.gpx' and 'Milan.html'.</p>
<h3>Launch the tool</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Linux</b>. Please open 'TravelGuideCreator' folder. Then launch the 'start.sh' file. When the console asks for the path to data folder, please enter the path to the folder where you store your database. We do not recommend locating your files in the 'TravelGuideCreator' folder itself.</p>
<p><b>Windows</b>. Open start.bat file.</p>
<h3>Import files</h3>
<p>Your file should be created in seconds. After that, please transfer it to your device. Specifically, to the folder where OsmAnd travel guides are stored. You can check the path to that folder in 'OsmAnd > Settings > General > Data storage folder > Manually specified. Please copy the file there using any mobile file manager or by connecting your phone to computer. Restart the app.</p>
<h3>Use your guide</h3>
<p>After you start the app, please go to 'Travel' menu. Press Options > 'Travel book' to select your database as a source. After that, you'll be able to use search normally in order to view the articles. You'll find all the points from your GPX track in 'Points' menu. Please use 'Show on map' button to view your points on the map. You can bookmark any article to have a quicker access to it.</p>
