<h1>OsmAnd 2.8</h1>
<div class="date">Oct. 18, 2017</div>
<p>OsmAnd 2.7.8 has been released! We're glad to share all the improvements so let's get started.</p>
<h4>Map marker menu</h4>
<p>The map marker menu has been completely reworked with a whole list of new features and a convenient intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>Quick reminder: map markers are points on the map you need short-term. A shop you've planned to visit today, an event location you'll only need once, etc. While favorites are the points you'll need in a long run, map markers are created and removed on the go.</p>
<p>To start using them, just make a long tap on the map and select the flag icon in the context menu. Done. Now, this point is your map marker. All of them are stored in the 'Map markers' menu in OsmAnd.  You can manage them in many ways. Press 'Options' menu to try the following:</p>
<ul class="textlist">
<li>'Sort by'. Sort your markers by name, by distance or by date added. Also, creating a route from map markers has become even easier. Just press 'Plan route' and check the markers you need. You can also use the 'Sort' button in this submenu to list them in a particular way.</li>
<li>Export all your markers at once as a GPX track. Simply select 'Save as new GPX track'. </li>
<li>When you do not need the markers anymore, press 'Move all to history' to discard them all at once.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p/>The 'Options' menu also has the 'Distance indication' feature. You can choose to show or hide the arrows pointing to 2 markers on the top of the list, enable or disable the guidelines connecting your location with those markers. You can select how you want to see the map markers menu on your map screen: as a top bar, using widgets or even hide it.</p>
<p>To change the order of your map markers, you can drag them using the 'â‰¡' button.</p>
<h4>Measure distance</h4>
<p>Measuring distances on the map has never been easier. Now you can add several points and view the distance between them. To use this feature, simply go to 'Measure distance' menu, place a point on the map and keep adding them one by one. You'll see the overall distance in the menu below. It is also possible to undo and redo every step or open the menu with details using the arrow icon. Press on a point on the map or on the list to move or delete it, add points before or after.</p>

<h4>OsmAnd Live</h4>
<p>The feature offering you frequent (up to once an hour) map updates has finally come out of the beta-testing phase and is fully ready for use. Extra improvement: now the map updates on the server will occur every 30 minutes. They'll be available for download once an hour, as usual.</p>
