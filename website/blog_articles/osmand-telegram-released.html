<h2>OsmAnd Telegram â€” Location Sharing</h2>
<div class="date">Sep 13, 2018</div>
<p>OsmAnd 3.1 is here! Here are some of the most important updates.</p>
<p>Our new application allows you to Share your location in real time with your contacts and groups from Telegram and view their locations on the map in OsmAnd Maps & Navigation.</p>
<p>OsmAnd Telegram - Location Sharing is a modified Telegram client created for flexible monitoring and sending of messages with GPS location.</p>
<p>The application sends the Live Location messages to the selected chats for the time you specified, displays a list of your contacts and groups, and checks the chats for the presence of the messages with a location, which are then displayed on the map in OsmAnd.
The application does not send or view your text messages.</p>

<p>Log in using your phone number registered in Telegram to enable the following:
<ul>
    <li>Manage the list of contacts and groups that send you their location</li>
    <li>View the location of contacts and groups in real time on a map in OsmAnd</li>
    <li>Set the time for sharing the location separately for each chat</li>
    <li>Set the location update frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>Some great news for  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap.org</a> contributors who use OsmAnd.
We have added synchronization of OSM Edit to Google App Backup, so now in the case of OsmAnd reinstallation, all your OSM edits that have not been uploaded yet will not be lost.
<p>We have corrected the error in the map notes. If the author of the note was anonymous, OsmAnd did not display the names of all the commentators.</p>
<p>The most important innovation for contributors: we have added the ability to edit tags for non-point objects and ways.</p></p>
