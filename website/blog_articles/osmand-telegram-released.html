<h2>OsmAnd Telegram — Location Sharing</h2>

<div class="date">Sep 13, 2018</div>


<p>We are pleased to announce that we have a new application in OsmAnd family. This application helps to see your contacts on the map in OsmAnd. It has a social aspect; you need to have contacts, that's why it was challenging for us to choose the platform to build it on. </p>

<p>We have chosen Telegram as the most open social platform because it has an Open API, Open SDK and, moreover, it will eventually have Open Server implementation (Blockchain).</p>
<p>It is important that we have a great level of interoperability between the applications. You can easily exchange your location with your contacts without having 'Telegram mobile app' (OsmAnd Telegram is an independent telegram client) and, the other way around, your contacts don't necessarily should have OsmAnd Telegram in order to see your location. We designed OsmAnd Telegram so you could still use your Telegram app and OsmAnd app naturally without flaws.</p>


<p>The application sends the Live Location messages to the selected chats for the time you specified, displays a list of your contacts and groups, and checks the chats for the presence of the messages with a location, which are then displayed on the map in OsmAnd.
The application does not send or view your text messages.</p>

<p>Log in using your phone number registered in Telegram to enable the following:
<ul>
    <li>Manage the list of contacts and groups that send you their location</li>
    <li>View the location of contacts and groups in real time on a map in OsmAnd</li>
    <li>Set the time for sharing the location separately for each chat</li>
    <li>Set the location update frequency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settings:</h3>
<p>There are several settings for managing the frequency of sharing locations and controlling the display of the locations sent to you.</p>
<p><b>Send my location</b> - allows you to set the interval for sending your position from once per second (for increasing accuracy) to once in 5 minutes (for reducing power consumption).</p>
<p><b>Stale location</b> - allows you to set the time (from 1 minute to 1 hour) after which the location of your contact will be considered outdated. If the location becomes outdated, the position becomes gray.</p>
<p><b>Location history</b> - allows setting the time (from 5 minutes to 24 hours) after which the contact with the deleted location will be hidden from the list and the OsmAnd map.</p>
<p>The OsmAnd Connect setting allows you to select the version of OsmAnd in which your contacts with the position will be displayed on the map.</p>

<h3>OsmAnd Assistant:</h3>
<p>We also prepared a Telegram bot called 'OsmAnd Assistant', so you can integrate OsmAnd Telegram with 3rd party trackers or APIs. So you can not only share your location but also location of your bicycle or a group of individuals from a racing which are available via API and "OsmAnd Telegram" will make sure you have a nice presentation of locations on the map in OsmAnd itself.</p>
<p>OsmAnd Telegram represents that we are not trying to lock-in our users into the single app and we are inlined with out mission to bring the value to the end-users by focusing on the strong side of our app meanwhile integrating with others. Recently we also expanded a lot our OsmAnd API's, so you can fine tune or write another app that will seamlessly integrate with OsmAnd. Please share with us what do you think about this new app on Twitter and other social channels.</p>
<p>To view the GPS positions of contacts on the map, you need the latest version of OsmAnd or OsmAnd+. The minimum supported version of OsmAnd or OsmAnd + is 3.0.4.</p>
