<h1>OsmAnd 3.0</h1>
<div class="date">May 15, 2018</div>
<p>OsmAnd has reached the 3.0 milestone! The version with a completely new 'Travel' menu, updates to GPX import and a different set of subscriptions is now available.</p>
<h3>Travel menu and WikiVoyage</h3>
<p>We aim at making OsmAnd not just your navigator but also your all-around travel companion. This is why we added the 'Travel' section to the menu. It offers you a handy travel guide to almost any big city â€“ download it to use offline later.</p>
<p>To find the right guide, enter the city name into search and press Save. You'll also see the information conveniently arranged by topics ('Get in', 'Talk', 'Eat', etc.). Next to that information, you'll find a set of points that cover all kinds of tourist needs: from landmarks to nearby supermarkets. You can share those points as GPX track or view their list in 'Points' menu.</p>
<p>By default, the articles will be displayed in the language of the application, but if you'd like, you can switch them using the translation button in the upper-right corner of the article. Adjust the feature to your needs: press 'Options' to enable or disable images, clear image cache, if needed, or delete search history.</p>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Wikipedia articles have been available in OsmAnd for a long time. In the new version, we updated the look of the pages for better user experience, added active links to the articles and also enabled images. All the content can now be viewed in OsmAnd's own browser. As always, all you have to do is download the Wiki file and enable the feature in Configure map > POI > Wikipedia.</p>
<h3>Map markers coordinate input improved</h3>
<p>The menu allowing you to add map markers by their coordinates has been reworked, as well. You can now conveniently change the pole for your coordinates and name your points.</p>
<h3>New system of subscriptions</h3>
<p>The system of OsmAnd purchases has become even more convenient. From now on, you can subscribe to the features that you need. For example, you need frequent map updates and nautical depth contours. And the next month you'd like to view contour lines, hillshade and WikiVoyage articles offline.
