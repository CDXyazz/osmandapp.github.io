<h2>Giveaway</h2>
<div class="date">Dec 29, 2018</div>
<p>We know that not everyone is able to purchase OsmAnd on Google Play / Amazon store or to purchase maps for OsmAnd on iTunes store due to various reasons, but many of you would still like to support the application by using it and spreading it around the world.</p>
<p>OsmAnd team decided to do a small present for our subscribers during this Christmas. And we started our True Giveaway based on Bitcoin. A little bit technical information: the number of promocodes is limited and each round 1 participant is selected for 1 promocode based on random number. The source of random is the latest available Bitcoin  Block hash. More information you can read and find out <a href="https://osmand.net/giveaway">on our website</a>. </p>



<h3>Christmas - first time</h3>
<p>We have significantly improved the Parsing algorithms of Wikipedia articles, fixed the problems with  French and Italian languages in which there were practically no articles.
    The mistakes in the articles content processing in Wikivoyage have also been eliminated. 
    The updated Wikipedia and Wikivoyage files are already available.</p>
