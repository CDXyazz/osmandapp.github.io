<h1>OsmAnd 2.6</h1>
<div class="date">Apr. 5, 2017</div>
<p>We're glad to announce that version 2.6 has been released! We're proud to present some major improvements and new features and hope you'll enjoy them. Here are the details.</p>
<h4>Quick action button</h4>
<p>Finding the balance between adding all the necessary features and yet keeping the user interface simple has always been a challenge. We were looking for ways to preserve all the features that come in handy for tourists, mappers, cyclists, drivers and travelers. At the same time, it was necessary to make OsmAnd convenient for day-to-day use. In the version 2.6, we decided to add the quick action button. It is a menu providing access to your most frequently used features: You select and add them to this 'toolbar', so the next time you need to add a new favorite, add navigation destination, or enable voice guidance, you can do it in seconds. The quick action button is available in Configure screen menu. To add actions to the menu, please press 'Add action' right on the menu bar. To remove an action, please go to Configure screen and press 'Quick action' menu. Then remove the features you do not need.</p>

<h4>Improved search menu</h4>
<p>Some users reported they liked the new simple search field, while others said they preferred the previous step-by-step search better. So we decided to combine both approaches. Now, if you open the Search menu, you'll see three tabs: History, Categories, and Address. The third one allows you to search by address, by postcode or by coordinates, like it was in the previous versions.</p>

<h4>Elevation and slope profile for calculated routes</h4>
<p>This feature has been long requested, especially by hikers and tourism enthusiasts. Now you can see very detailed info about your navigation route. Just calculate a route, then tap the information button in the navigation context menu (right where you see the information about distance and time). You'll see the route's elevation profile. To view it along with the route on the map, please select 'Analyze on map' menu. The graph is interactive, just slide it to the left or right to see the numbers for a specific point. More to come, now you can view it in Altitude, Slope mode or combine them (menu Altitude/Slope).</p>

<h4>Detailed profile for recorded tracks</h4>
<p>In this release, we paid a lot of attention to the GPX management and have come up wit a completely new screen showing the details of your GPX track. Now tracks also come with the detailed information about elevation and slopes. We added a new screen with altitude data, track overview and interactive representation of the terrain details. Besides that, you'll see the time you spent on the track and its length right below the graph. Just like with navigation routes, GPX graphics are interactive, and if you click on the graphic, you'll see the details for each specific point. 
On the same screen, you'll have the option allowing you to view both track info and the GPX itself on the map. To try that, press 'Analyze on map'.</p>
<p>To explore a track, just go to My places - My tracks and select the one you need. You can also view as many tracks on the map as you want. Simply go to My places - My tracks menu, press the map icon and pick the tracks.</p>

<h4>Nautical Depth Contour lines</h4>
<p>If you enter the Download maps menu, you'll notice the file named 'Depth contours ' next to the 'World seamarks' map. This feature gives you access to information about the sea floor, just like the contour lines plugin does with the mountain terrain.   To use the feature, please enable Nautical map view in Plugins menu. Then go to Configure map - Details and enable 'Depth contours' option.</p>

<h4>Driving style setting for cyclists</h4>
<p>We all prioritize differently when it comes to reaching a destination. Maybe you are in a hurry and need the fastest route or maybe you'd prefer the safest one. For this case specifically, you can now choose how your route will be built. If you go to the navigation context menu and press the Settings button (the one with the gear wheel), you can select the style you need. Just open the 'Driving style' menu to choose in favor of Speed, Safety or pick the Balanced version.</p>

<h4>New map fonts covering more locales</h4>
<p>We also added new fonts to the 2.6 version covering more locales. Specifically, we replaced the default ones with Noto Font, which will eliminate the display issues for many languages. Besides that, the users can download full sets of characters for more convenient map usage. Available for simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. As always, you can select your map language in Configure map - Map language menu.</p>
<h4>Support Open Location Code (OLC)</h4>
<p>From now on, OsmAnd supports the Open Location Code. This code represents coordinates of a certain point as a combination of letters and numbers. This way of representation is considered to be easier than the traditional latitude and longitude coordinates. Please read more about the code <a href="http://openlocationcode.com/">here</a>.
You can search locations by this code, as well. To try that, please go to Search menu - Address - Coordinates Search and select 'OLC' in Coordinate Format submenu. You'll also see a location's OLC in the context menu of a point.</p>
