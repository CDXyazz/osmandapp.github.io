<h2>Detailed OSM changes stats</h2>

<div class="date">Sep 30, 2018</div>
<p>This is an tremendous example how small change in OpenStreetMap API could make an impact on other applications. As part of our OsmAnd Live initiative we collected for last 2 years detailed stats about OSM changes. As of today we gathered information about all changesets, all users and all editors. What is unique about our stats that we also collecting it by multiple world regions. </p>
<p>
Though we've been always asked to focus on how many objects were changed rather than how many changesets are submitted. This month that change was finally merged into platform <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/1947">https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/1947</a>. So the rest implementation was pretty clear for us and it is finally in place as well.
