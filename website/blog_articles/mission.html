<h2>OsmAnd Mission</h2>
<div class="date">June 28, 2018</div>
<p>The OsmAnd team has been working on open-source maps mobile applications and receiving support from our community for many years now.
    The time has come to create a manifest describing our place in the world of IT by explaining why we prefer some solutions/products/technologies pver others,
    clarifying our values, and strengthening our long-term relationship with the community.</p>
<span class="quote">Our defined goal is to create universally helpful open-source offline travel tools and to encourage crowdsourcing initiatives worldwide.</span>
<h3>Open-sSurce for Crowd-Source</h3>
<p>We strongly believe that open-source applications make the world a better place by not competing for revenue, but competing for
    making the best product. The same applies to the crowd-sourced projects where data is open to everybody. Open-source
    and crowd-source are not the same: There are multiple projects that are truly open-source while have a lot of non-accessible
    data, and sometimes crowd-source projects have more valuable data than the product itself.</p>
<p>When OsmAnd was first launched, the app was based solely on OpenStreetMap. Later, we moved on adding Wikipedia support, Mapillary
    imagery, and Wikivoyage. In this fashion, everybody can contribute and see results in the app within a month or even within the hour (via
    an OsmAnd Live subscription).</p>
<p>Along these lines, the most important idea behind OsmAnd is to continue to be a long-sustained project
    open for any kind of contributionm and at the same time our code with can be used by anyone for non-commercial purposes.</p>
<h3>Respect for Privacy</h3>
<p>In OsmAnd, we strongly respect the privacy of every individual seeing it as an integral part of human dignity. Our principles of
    of data protection include:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>
        <b>Geolocation data</b>. We recognize geolocation data as a critical and sensitive personal information which we will never store, nor share
		   with any third party.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Digital footprint</b>. We consider IT footptint data like the screen resolution or IP address as sensitive.
        Global services aggregating such information can use it to assemble a digital footprints, track users,
        deliver personalized ads, etc., hence we entirely avoid using such services and do not transfer such data to third parties.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Simple Analytics</b>. We aim at making the best application possible and want to be sure it runs smoothly under all
        conditions. Therefoe we may collect anonymous and geo-imprecise information strictly for internal purposes. Of course, we
        always provide a way to opt out.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Ads</b>. Again, in the spirit of protecting everyone's privacy, we intend to keep OsmAnd entirely ad-free. We strongly rely
        on the 'pay for the app' model as a sustainable and reliable solution.</li>
    <h3>Community Support</h3>
    <p>Communities have great power and potential to evolve and make a difference for themselves and their goals. Our goal is to create tools
        that will help people share and update information about their surroundings and environment. In OsmAnd, you can almost instantly add new data to the map,
        and such data becomes available to others. In this fashion, maps quickly become extremely detailed, which in turn improves OsmAnd and its use and value
		for activities like driving, hiking, cycling, sailing, traveling abroad, and in many other ways.</p>
    <p>OsmAnd also supports mappers through the 'OsmAnd Live' initiative, where users purchase a subscription to frequent
        map updates and other tools, and those funds become rewards for the contributors.</p>
    <p>We are strong supporters of a <i>'do it yourself'</i> spirit. When you support the project, you do it for yourself as well as for
        the global community. When you translate, update, code, test, or leave feedback – you fine-tune the very instrument
        people all over the world use every day. And they are doing the same in return.</p>
    <h3>Reliable Maps Available to Anyone</h3>
    <p>We are convinced that OsmAnd has to be accessible to anyone. That is why the free version is globally available and has
        a full functionality. Everyone deserves to have access to reliable maps working without the internet and we intend
        to develop new possibilities in this area.</p>
    <p>P.S. Please support us by funding, purchasing, contributing to OsmAnd or related crowd-source projects, and we will keep
        supporting you by creating open-source apps, maintaining them, funding mappers, spreading openness in the world.</p>
    <p>It’s a cycle of support in an Open World!</p>
