<p>We always strived to make OsmAnd not just your navigator, but your all-around travel guide. That's why, in version 3.0, the 'Travel guides' option has been added.</p>

<p>Enjoy offline guides for basically any destination. The guides are based on Wikivoyage, a community project similar to Wikipedia, where volunteer writers create articles with real and up-to-date information. Such information includes the main facts about a place, transport, landmarks, shopping spots, etc.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_use"><h2>How to use the guides</h2></div>
<p>To start using the feature, please go to Download maps > Travel guides > 'Worldwide Wikivoyage articles' and download the file. Now all your guides are saved on device and you can look up any information, even if you're abroad or out of a mobile network area.</p>
<p>As soon as the file is downloaded, you can start using the guides. Just go to OsmAnd > 'Travel guides' and enter the name of the city into the search field. As soon as you open the article, you'll see the information conveniently arranged by topic. You can also press 'Bookmark' to have a quick access to this article later.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="Customize_your_guide"><h2>Customize your guide</h2></div>
<p>You can also choose if you'd like to download the images or not, clear image cache or delete the search history. To do that, please press the 'Options button' in the upper-right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>The articles are available in different languages. By default, the language you're using in OsmAnd will be also picked for Wikivoyage. But if you'd like, you can view your article in a different one. To do that, press the translation button next to the name of the article.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="Waypoints"><h2>Waypoints</h2></div>
<p>Articles often contain waypoints grouped by topic. They are available in the 'Points' menu at the bottom of the article. You'll see food locations,  airports, railway stations, places to shop, main historical attractions, accommodation options, etc. To view them all on the map, please enable 'Show on map' option. The track with the points will be also available in My places > My tracks > Travel. To remove the waypoints from the map, please go to 'Configure map' menu and disable the 'GPX track' option.</p>
<p>Besides the city guides, you can read about regions or countries, and even scroll through special guides like the list of UNESCO Global Geoparks Network or even a phrasebook of a country you're visiting. To see more exciting articles, please see the 'Explore' tab of the travel guides menu.</p>
