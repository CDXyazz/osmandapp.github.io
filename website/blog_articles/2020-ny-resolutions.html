<p>Happy New 2020 Year!</p>

<p>Every year we follow tradition to write New Year Resolutions. First of all we would like to describe our achievements, compare them with <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/2019-ny-resolutions">2019 Resolutions</a> and prepare a new list for 2020.</p>

<h3>2019 achievements</h3>

<img src="/images/blog/2019/2019-NY-1.PNG" alt="(Image not available offline)"/>

<p>First of all, we would like to congratulate our CEO <b>Victor Shcherb</b> who was awarded during <a href="http://weeklyosm.eu/archives/12408">SotM-2019 in Heilderberg, Germany (Ulf Möller Memorial Award)</a> for creating OsmAnd application and supporting it over the years, keeping it the only major OSM-based app with no corporate influence, and constantly imagining ways to expand user-facing side of open data.</p>

	<h4>Android</h4>

<p>OsmAnd Android got 3 major releases this year (<a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-3-released">3.3</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-4-released">3.4</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-5-released">3.5</a>) with more than <a href="https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/milestones?state=closed">300 public features and issues closed on Github</a>. Among all these features we’ve selected 3 major features which were in the Resolutions list for 2019.</p>

	<li><b>Public transport</b><br>

<div class="blogimageblock">
<img src="/images/blog/3.3/pt_2_blog.png"/>
<img src="/images/blog/3.3/pt_3_blog.png"/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>We’ve introduced Navigation for public transport in early <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-3-released">version 3.3</a> and did multiple fixes in <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-4-released">3.4</a> as well. You can also watch the presentation on Youtube.</p>

 <p>It was an important step to introduce Public Transport worldwide without limits. We dealt with thousands map issues and we welcomed OSM-community <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/guideline-pt">to improve the map</a> and use OsmAnd as a test application.</p> 

<p>We know that many users are waiting for schedule support or at least [opening_hours] + [interval]. And we have plans to improve it in 2020.</p>

	<li><b>Application profiles</b><br> 

<p>New application profiles is our long term goal and we’ve started working on it this year. There is a lot of work left for next 2020 though we try to bring something new each release to give an impression of the end goal and get a necessary feedback from our users. So far all settings are made separate, so you can customize application in various ways for different purposes.</p>

<div class="blogimageblock">
<img src="/images/blog/3.5/7.jpg"/>
<img src="/images/blog/3.5/14.jpg"/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>The most important update was to allow to create custom profiles and have button to import and export settings associated with this profile. You can choose a specific icon and color to have a unique look and feel. Next year we are expecting to include associated Quick Actions, Maps, custom Poi Categories, Plugins etc.</p>

	<li><b>Powerful Route details</b><br> 

<div class="blogimageblock">
<img src="/images/blog/3.3/pt_8_blog.png"/>
<img src="/images/blog/3.3/pt_9_blog.png"/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>As of <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-3-released">3.3</a> route details screen have important information about road types, surface conditions, steepness displayed in a nice visual way. It is a top priority for us to migrate that functionality to iOS. This mechanism quite advanced and everybody could contribute and create own metrics by modifying just rendering style on own device. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OsmAnd/comments/dndhsg/pieter_with_osmand_from_2011/">Peter</a> who contributed road information for Ski Pistes this way.</p>

	<li><b>What else?</b><br> 

<p>We’ve redesigned <b>Directions screens</b>, improved <b>Quick action</b>, added a <b>Widget with Current Coordinate</b>s and <b>the Compass</b> to the Radius ruler, added <b>Ski Routing</b>, updated <b>Basemap</b>, <b>Desert style</b> for map and lot’s of else.</p>

	<h4>iOS</h4>

<p>We did <b>7 releases</b> of OsmAnd for iOS this year (<a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-5-released">2.5</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-7-released">2.7</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-8-released">2.8</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-9-released">2.9</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-3-0-released">3.0</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-3-10-released">3.10</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-3-11-released">3.11</a>)! All this was possible because of high commitment from our iOS team to catch up with Android. We plan that 2020 will be a special year when almost all features will be equal between Android and iOS. Here the list of main features released this year for iPhones and iPads.</p>

	<li><b>OsmAnd Live</b><br> 

<p>OsmAnd Live is a tiny subscription that provides you numerous benefits, such as unlimited downloads, access to all paid features and map hourly updates.</p>

	<li><b>OpenStreetMap (OSM) Editing</b><br> 

<p>OSM Editing allows you to make contributions to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, a global community aimed at creating a comprehensive map of the world and providing up-to-date open-source data to every user.</p>

</div>

	<li><b>Quick Action menu</b><br> 

<p>This feature was asked many times this year and we’re proud to deliver it in 2019. It allows you to have instant access to various actions with 2 clicks from the main screen, e.g. to change a map style, to show specific POI, to switch between raster maps or disable some layers.</p>

<h3>New Year Resolutions 2020</h3>

<p>New year we are going to start with an extended team of 7 software engineers, we grew to 20% compared to the previous year and it is good news, so we can probably do 10% more in 2020 :-)</p>

<p>Our list is growing every year and as of today, we have around 1500 requests waiting to be fixed. That’s why it is important for us to set up some public goals and try to follow it to a certain extent.</p>

<h4>GENERAL</h4>

<ul class="textlist">
	<li><b>New slopes / hillshade maps</b><br> In 2019 we’ve released updated contour lines worldwide and started working on new raster hillshade and slope maps. We want to provide more detailed raster maps and also add a new type of maps to better visualize slope.</li><br>

	<li><b>Profiles on Android + iOS</b><br> This is considered to be the most important feature for 2020. It was already started in 2019 and now Android users can create / import and export custom profiles with user-defined settings. We’re going to continue profile’s customization, so every profile could look and feel as a separate geo-specialized application. Also we want to make it easy to share with others.</li><br>

</ul>

<h4>Android</h4>

<ul class="textlist">
	<li><b>OpenGL-rendering + 2.5D</b><br> This is a long running feature for several years and we have a prototype build, we’ve already added some features to our roadmap to be implemented. Though we are not planning to make it mainstream unless it will be very successful. You can always check out the version we have at  <a href="https://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAnd-qt-arm-nightly.apk">our build server</a>.</li><br>

	<li><b>Travel + Wikivoyage improvements</b><br> This year we didn’t manage to implement many features related to Wikivoyage, though it is always in our focus. We plan to make a second version inspired by our new plugin architecture.</li><br>

	<li><b>Local GPX-access</b><br> Every year we develop many tiny and useful features related to GPX and this 2019 year was not an exception. We’ve closed more than 50 GPX-related issues. In 2020 we plan to add new features how to interact with GPX on the map, how to browse and search among large list of GPX files and new ways how to visualize GPX-activities.</li><br>
</ul>

<h4>iOS</h4>

<ul class="textlist">
	<li><b>Public Transport</b><br> This feature was done for Android in 2019 and we plan to migrate all solutions  we implemented to iOS in 2020. So OSM-ers with IPhones will get a new motivation to map public transport in OSM (<a href="https://osmand.net/blog/guideline-pt">check out our guideline</a>).</li><br>

	<li><b>Measure Distance</b><br> We’ve got a lot of requests that <a href="https://osmand.net/features/measure-distance">this tool</a> is very helpful and for sure it is number 1 priority to get it in IOS in 2020.</li><br>

	<li><b>GPX</b><br> As Android version gets more advanced-GPX related features, iOS version still lacks some base route graphs and stats. Of course it is very important for us not to miss it next year.</li><br>
</ul>


<p><b>Sure, many of hundreds of small features didn’t get to this list though they’re going to be developed in 2020.</b></p>

<b><p>Happy 2020 and let’s welcome OsmAnd 2020!!!</b></p>
