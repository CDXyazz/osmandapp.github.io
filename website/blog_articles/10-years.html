<p><b>Hello everyone!</b></p>

<p>On June 3, 2010, the first OsmAnd navigation app version was released. Today, our company is 10 years old. During the Decade, we have gone from amateur project to the company, which mobile app is used all around the globe, from the company with only a couple of dozen active users to an application with 2 million active users per month.</p>

<p>Over these 10 years, OsmAnd has been actively developing, so in 5 years after the first release on Android, the iOS version was released. We add new functions and improve already present ones every year. That's why our users call the app a Swiss Army knife.</p>

<p>During these 10 years, we have been an open-source project without any in-app ads or data collection tools. We consider ourselves as part of the large  OpenStreetMap community. Therefore, we remain an opensource project with no ads or user data collection tools for another 10 years.</p>

<p>We will continue developing our projects, reaching active users, and working for you. Happy Birthday, OsmAnd!</p>
