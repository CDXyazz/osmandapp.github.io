<h1>OsmAnd 1.2.2 for iOS is now released</h1>
<div class="date">Sept 10, 2015</div>
<p>The new OsmAnd release has a list of new features that are waiting to be tried out. You can now use shading on the map to see the relief, plan trips and search for points of interest in a handy way. Let's get to details.</p>
<h2>POI on the map</h2>
<p>One of the significant steps forward is the ability to view POI on the map. From now on, you'll be able to view any points of interest as you enter the Search. From healthcare to parking to tourist attractions - search for the point you need through all the categories or choose one type of POI to see what's around your location.</p>
<h2>Hillshade maps</h2>
<p>The OsmAnd iOS version now has the hillshade maps. Those are map layers visualizing the details of the terrain. The hillshade maps are available by country. To use the hillshade, don't forget to go to the map settings, turn on the hillshade and choose it as either under- or overlay.</p>
<h2>Trip planning</h2>
<p>You can create a trip by adding the waypoints. That will allow you to plan your trip beforehand and then follow the route. Please note that it's not the same as a full GPX track. The waypoints will be connected by straight lines to help you get the general idea of the directions.</p>
<h2>New destination management</h2>
<p>As you add waypoints, you'll see them in a toolbar on the top of the screen. Now you can view waypoints or delete them by tapping on the upper toolbar and swiping to the left. Tap the arrow to unfold the full list and choose the point you need to get to in order to see the distance to it and view the location on map. Please note that the points are connected by straight lines and are meant to help you create a general understanding of the directions for your trip.  Also, now you can add an endless number of waypoints.</p>
<h2>Improvement in POI search</h2>
<p>As you search for the points of interests, your previous destinations will be added to make searching even easier. The same applies to the favorites.</p>
<p>The new version also has lots of small improvements to make the user experience better. Go ahead and try out OsmAnd 1.2.2. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps/id934850257?mt=8">Install!</a></p>
