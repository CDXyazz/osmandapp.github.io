<p>One of the significant steps forward is the ability to view POI on the map. From now on, you'll be able to view any points of interest as you enter the Search. From healthcare to parking to tourist attractions - search for the point you need through all the categories or choose one type of POI to see what's around your location.</p>
<h2>Hillshade maps</h2>

<p>The OsmAnd iOS version now has the hillshade maps. Those are map layers visualizing the details of the terrain. The hillshade maps are available by country. To use the hillshade, don't forget to go to the map settings, turn on the hillshade and choose it as either under- or overlay.</p>
<h2>Trip planning</h2>

<p>You can choose to sort your waypoints in the order you added them or by the distance from waypoints to your current location. Do use this option, just hit the 'roadsign' icon. This way, you'll be able to start from the closest or choose the farthest and move back. Also, you can change the order of waypoints as you need. Just tap the blue toolbar, then swipe the waypoint you'd like to move higher on the list and tap the arrow icon. To mark it as visited, select the checkbox sign. Also, similar checkboxes will be available as soon as you approach the waypoints.</p>
<h2>New destination management</h2>

<p>As you add waypoints, you'll see them in a toolbar on the top of the screen. Now you can view waypoints or delete them by tapping on the upper toolbar and swiping to the left. Tap the arrow to unfold the full list and choose the point you need to get to in order to see the distance to it and view the location on map. Please note that the points are connected by straight lines and are meant to help you create a general understanding of the directions for your trip.  Also, now you can add an endless number of waypoints.</p>
<h2>Improvement in POI search</h2>
<p>As you search for the points of interests, your previous destinations will be added to make searching even easier. The same applies to the favorites.</p>
<p>The new version also has lots of small improvements to make the user experience better. Go ahead and try out OsmAnd 1.2.2. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps/id934850257?mt=8">Install!</a></p>
