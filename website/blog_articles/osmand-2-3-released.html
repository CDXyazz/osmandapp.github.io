<h1>OsmAnd 2.3</h1>
<div class="date">March 6, 2016</div>
<p>OsmAnd 2.3 is on its way! Get ready for a brand new route preparation interface, improved UI, and more. We also added a revolutionary feature for you to try. Read on to find out about all the new things in 2.3 version and hurry to update it!</p>
<h4>OSM Live Beta</h4>
<p>The most important and outstanding feature of the new release is OSM Live. It's the system that will encourage OSM mappers to update the information and will give you frequent updates (up to once an hour). You make a donation and receive the updates, 30% goes to the OsmAnd team and 70% is spread between OSM contributors who have registered in the OSM Live program. They are encouraged to make more updates and you get fresh and more detailed maps. Please read more and join <a href="http://osmand.net/osm_live#information">here</a>.</p>
<p>While the feature is in beta version, the updates will not cover routing: the road chnges will be applied only during regular monthly updates.</p>

<h4>New map markers interface</h4>
<p>Map markers are points you can add to the route or leave for future trips. What if you'll need this location just once but not on the current trip? Maybe you liked this shop and decided to visit it after work? No need to add it as a favorite and remove it again. Just leave a map marker - a point you'll use in future or add to your current route. In the completely reworked route preparation menu, you can choose to add a point to the route as last intermediate point, destination, etc., see favorites, POI, and traffic warnings, choose which you need and delete the rest. For example, you created a route and want to see some fun places on your way. You turn on the Leisure POI category and delete the points you do not need, leaving only the main ones. You can also remove the intermediate destinations in seconds on the same screen.</p>

<p>Now, you'll see the address when you tap a location on the map. This makes map use even smoother. Besides that, text rendering throughout the application has become better.</p>
