<div class="subtitle" id="about_map_markers"><h2>What are map markers</h2></div>
<p>Markers interface is a convenient tool that helps you save points on the map for your short-term needs. While favorites are often places you'll visit multiple times (like your gym, friend's house, etc.), markers are used to locate the places you may need once: a shop you'll need to stop by, a gas station on your long trip, etc.</p>

<p>To use the markers, make a long tap on the map and press the flag icon. That's it. You saved that point as a marker. You can view the list in the 'Map markers' menu. This interface is extremely flexible, so there are many ways you can arrange the markers. In the 'Map markers' menu, you'll see three main tabs:</p>
<p><b>List</b> This tab shows the list of markers and allows you to change their order. To rearrange your markers, simply use the '≡' button to drag them up or down the list. To remove a marker, press the '✓' button next to it.</p>
<p><b>Groups</b> This tab sorts the markers by date which allows you to conveniently pick those created on a certain day. For example, you can view all the points you added the day before. You can import your favorites as a separate markers group and do the same with your GPX waypoints. Simply go to Map markers > Groups and press '+'.</p>
<p><b>History</b> Here, you'll see the markers you removed. To restore any of them, use the '↻' button next to it.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="advanced"><h2>Advanced options</h2></div>
<p>There are some advanced options you can try. Press the  'Options' menu to try the following:</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="sort"><h4>Sorting your markers</h4></div>
<p>Select the 'Sort by' option to sort the points by the distance, by name or by the date they've been added (ascending or descending).</p>

</div>
<div class="subtitle" id="choosing-indication-type"><h4>Choosing the indication type</h4></div>
<p>You can set how you'd like to view your markers - using the top bar on the map screen or the widgets. You can also select not to view this type of info on the map using the 'None' option.</p>
<p>This menu also allows you to view the guide lines to the markers or show their direction using arrows. To try it, enable 'Show arrows on the map' and 'Show guide line' features.</p>

</div>
<div class="subtitle" id="planning"><h4>Planning a route</h4></div>
<p>Planning a route from your map markers is very easy. Press 'Plan route' and select the markers you need. You can also customize the route. After you've selected the markers, press 'Options' in the upper-right corner and chose the additional features you need.</p>
<p>Press 'Navigate' to create a navigation route using the points. If you need to return to your first point, select 'Make a round trip'. 'Sort door-to-door' option creates a route by arranging the points in the most convenient way (based on their distance to each other). The 'reverse order' function reverses the last selected order of the points. (So if you select door-to-door and then reverse, the points will still be sorted door-to-door, but the route will be created in the opposite direction.)</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="coordinates"><h4>Adding markers by coordinates</h4></div>
<p>Besides selecting a point on the map, you can also enter its coordinates. To try it, please go to Map markers > Options > Coordinate input.</p>
<p>Enter the coordinates, then name your marker. Press 'Options' for additional features: 'Use system keyboard' sets your device's keyboard as default, 'Go to next field' automatically switches to the next field when the current one is completed. 'Digits quantity' selects how many digits will your coordinate indicator have.</p>
