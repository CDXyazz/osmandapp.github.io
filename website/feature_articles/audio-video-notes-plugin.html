<p>AV Notes Plugin stores media files in a format:</p>
<p>{SHORTLINK_LOCATION}_Description.{avi,mp3,jpg} where SHORTLINK_LOCATION is encoded latitude/longitude according to specification https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shortlink.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="Add_notes_to_GPX_track"><h2>Add notes to your GPX track</h2></div>
<p>You can use this plugin while recording the GPX track. This way, all your notes will be added to the track as waypoints automatically. When viewing the track, you&#39ll see exactly what was recorded where.</p>
<p>To view everything later, you can export the track together with all the media and see them in the  <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM editor</a>. Please note that you&#39ll need to put the media in the corresponding folder (you&#39ll know which one if you click on a video note and see the message about a missing file. Just put it in the indicated folder).</p>
