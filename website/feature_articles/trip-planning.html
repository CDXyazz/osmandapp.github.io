<p>You can create a new route using the Navigation option of the app. This tool is designed to help you find an optimal route according to your vehicle, personal requirements, etc. You can choose a car, bicycle or pedestrian mode, choose to avoid certain types of roads, etc. As soon as the route is build, you'll get a turn-by-turn voice guidance.
If you'd like to save the track of your movement, just turn the Trip recording plugin on and start a new GPX track before you proceed.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Route_from_Favorites"><h2>Making a route from Favorites</h2></div>
<p>You can join your favorites into a route. This is especially handy on vacations and trips to new places: add the points you'd like to visit to Favorites and then build a route covering them all. To do that, just go to your Favorites list by tapping Show All next to Favorites in the Dashboard. Then tap the flag icon on the bottom. Now you can choose the locations to visit. After that, tap the flag icon once again. You'll be able to order the points by the way they are sorted on your Favorites list or use the Door-by-door option. This option arranges the points to make the most comfortable route. For instance, you can start with your waypoint number 2, then four, then five, etc. if they are located closer to each other. You can also add waypoints after the route is calculated. Just tap on the map and choose Add as waypoint. You'll be able to arange the waypoints after that. Choose your starting point in the navigation menu. You can start the route from your current position, a Favorite on the map,  the point on map you select or a particular address.</p>
