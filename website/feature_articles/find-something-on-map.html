<h1>How to find something on the map</h1>
<p>You may want to find the nearest location of a certain type, see your own location or search for a place by zip code. Just use the guide below.</p>
<p>Please note: to accomplish some of these tasks (locate addresses, POI, etc.) you will need to have the offline vector map file.</p>
<p>In the Search option, there are six tabs (from left to right):</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>POI (Point Of Interest) search &ndash; used for finding specific places of your interest (museums, landmarks, etc.)</li>
<li>POI (Point Of Interest) search &ndash; used for finding specific places of your interest (museums, landmarks, etc.)</li>
<li>Address search &ndash; consists of four options (Region, City, Street and Building)</li>
<li>Coordinates &ndash; used for finding a place via its coordinates</li>
<li>Favorites search &ndash; used for searching your favorite places</li>
<li>Search history &ndash; self-explanatory</li>
<li>Transportation search &ndash; self-explanatory</li>
<li>You can also move to the section you need by tapping Search POI/Address/Coordinates or History on the dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find your own position</h2>
<p>Enable GPS or network positioning and wait while the device discovers your position.
Once done, you have to press the &#39;target&#39; button on the right and the map will be zoomed to your area and centered to your location. The light blue circle around you is accuracy of the position detection. You can also enable displaying your current viewing direction, which will follow any device rotation if your device is equipped with compass sensors. You may want to go to Settings - General - Kalman filter to reduce noise in compass readings.</p>

<h2>Find Points of Interest (POI):</h2>
<p>You need pre-loaded vector maps to be able to use this feature.</p>
<p>Go to the dashboard, then tap Search - POI. Next select category or a predefined filter. Select also where you want to search: around your current position, the point currently viewed on the map, a certain other location, etc. After the first search is completed, you may increase the search radius to your needs. To do that, just tap search again (the radius can cover up to 5000 km). Tap on POI to choose Show on Map, Set as Destination, or Show POI description.</p>
<p>Also, if you turn on the Online plugin and download raster maps, you&#39;ll be able to search POI by name. This way, your result will be broader. Just type the name of the location and tap Search - Nominatim or Search - Address.</p>

<h2>Find an address</h2>
<p>Press Search - POI, then go to Address tab. 
If you do not have a vector map file for the region in question, you can only perform an online internet search. If you have an offline vector map, simply follow through the guidance by selectively filling the country, city, street, etc. fields. Possible choices of all hits found in your offline data will always be displayed.
At any point, you may select Show on Map or Set as Destination.
Note: OsmAnd autofills your search when typing, but only on cities and towns. If you type (the beginning of) a village (or smaller) and nothing is displayed, you need to press the Search villages/postcode.</p>
<p>Zipcode/postcode: In the city field start typing the zipcode and when done tap the Search villages/postcode button.</p>
