<h1>How to use navigation</h1>
<p>The navigation function allows you to reach your destination easily using voice guidance (optional).</p>
<p>To start the navigation, you need to use the navigation button on the map screen. Next, you'll need to set the starting point and the destination. As for the starting point, you can choose your current location, Favorite location, select a point on the map or use an address. You can also set a starting point by long tapping on the map and choosing 'Set as destination' in the menu box. It is the same with the destination point. As soon as your  points are selected, the app will create a route and will start guiding you after you tap Go.</p>
<p>When the navigation is running, you can press the home button. You will get the message 'OsmAnd is runing in the background'. This means that even if you turn the screen off or exit the active app window, you'll still get voice prompts. You can also choose to turn the screen on before turns. To do that, go to Settings &mdash; Navigation Settings &mdash; Turn screen on and set for how long you'd like to keep the screen on. For instance, if you pick 10 seconds, the screen will be on for 10 seconds on the turn and then switch off again till the next turn.</p>

<p><b>What are TTS and pre-recorded voice prompts</b></p>
<p>There are two types of voices in OsmAnd: TTS or text-to-speech generated voice prompts and those created from pre-recorded voices. You can switch between them to pick the type that's more comfortable to you. TTS is preferable as it functions in a more flexible way. Choose the voice prompt type you like in Settings &mdash; General &mdash; Voice prompts &mdash; Install more. There, you'll see two gruops of vocie prompts and can pick the option you prefer.</p>
