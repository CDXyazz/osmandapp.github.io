<p>The navigation function allows you to reach your destination easily using voice guidance (optional).</p>

<p>To start the navigation, you need to use the navigation button on the map screen. Next, you'll need to set the starting point and the destination. As for the starting point, you can choose your current location, Favorite location, select a point on the map or use an address. You can also set a starting point by long tapping on the map and choosing 'Directions from' in the menu box. To navigate to a point, just press the navigation button in its context menu. As soon as your  points are selected, the app will create a route and will start guiding you after you tap Start.</p>

<p>When the navigation is running, you can press the home button. You will get the message 'OsmAnd is running in the background'. This means that even if you turn the screen off or exit the active app window, you'll still get voice prompts. For Android versions other than 3.3, we have added the “Turn on screen” option. This allows you to show the map on the lock screen during navigation. Now, this function does not request any permissions for the correct operation. You can use it to save phone power. The function is configured separately for each profile. To configure, you need to select a profile that supports navigation and go to <i> Profile settings - Navigation settings - Map during navigation - Turn on the screen (move the slider to the ON state - should turn blue).</i></p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Navigation_profiles"><h2>Navigation profiles (for Android version only)</h2></div>

<p>In OsmAnd, to build a route, various basic profiles are available that take into account the specifics of the vehicle and traffic conditions. Routes are calculated differently for different navigation profiles following the rules of the road, given conditions, weights, various restrictions and will help you get to your destination, taking into account your method of movement. We also believe that it is not very convenient to use basic profiles for some special cases. Therefore, OsmAnd 3.5 added the ability to make your own profile with all the settings, icons, etc.</p>


<p>At the top of the main menu, you can see the active navigation profile and proceed to its configuration. You can set different parameters and special plugins for each profile separately.</p>

<p>To create a new profile based on the basic one, select in the general menu <i> "Settings" - "+ New Profile </i>". In the same settings, you can import a profile from a file. To get the profile file for import, go to <i>"Settings" - select the profile you want to export - "Export profile"</i>. In the same menu you can reset to default values.</p>

<p>You can read more about creating and configuring a navigation profile <a href="https://osmand.net/features/navigation-profiles">in this article</a>.</p>

<div class="blocksubtitle">What are TTS and pre-recorded voice prompts</div>

<p>OsmAnd has two types of voice guidance: TTS or simpler text-to-speech, and recording created from pre-recorded voices.
