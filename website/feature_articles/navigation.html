<h1>How to use navigation</h1>
<p>The navigation function allows you to reach your destination easily using voice guidance (optional).</p>
<p>To start the navigation, you need to use the navigation button on the map screen. Next, you'll need to set the starting point and the destination. As for the starting point, you can choose your current location, Favorite location, select a point on the map or use an address. You can also set a starting point by long tapping on the map and choosing 'Set as destination' in the menu box. It is the same with the destination point. As soon as your  points are selected, the app will create a route and will start guiding you after you tap Go.</p>
