<p>To use the plugin, simply tap and hold a spot on the map where your car is, then set it as a Parking spot and add a reminder if you'd like to get one. If you choose to get one, identify the length of your planned parking. When the times goes up, you'll get notified to go back and get your car. Also, check how far your parking spot is with a simple widget in the right upper corner of the screen.</p>
