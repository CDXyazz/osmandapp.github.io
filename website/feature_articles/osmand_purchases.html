<p>OsmAnd+ is a full version of OsmAnd. It provides you with an unlimited number of map downloads, including updates,  voice files, etc. Also, this version has Wikipedia feature in it. After downloading the Wikipedia file for your region and enabling Wikipedia in 'Configure map - POI' menu, you'll see Wiki articles attached to objects on the map and will be able to read them in your language. Please note that you can buy OsmAnd+ as a separate app on Google Play or buy it as an in-app purchase named 'OsmAnd Unlimited' from the free version of OsmAnd. In the latter case, you won't have to install OsmAnd+, you'll just have all the features unlocked in your OsmAnd app.

<div class="subtitle" id="ios_extended_features"><h2>iOS extended features</h2></div>
<p>The purchase system in iOS is a little different from that on Android. The Nautical maps and Contour lines are available for purchase while the Wikipedia plugin is free. The map downloads are available in bundles in case you do not need the maps of the entire world at the moment. For example, you can get the maps of Africa or Europe. Of course, free map downloads are available, as well. To view all the options, please visit the 'Maps & Resources' menu. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps/id934850257">Get OsmAnd for iOS</a>.</p>
