<p>The 'Measure distance' allows you to measure distances on the map, create and edit GPX tracks.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, simply go to the main OsmAnd menu and press 'Measure distance'. You'll see the map with a tool bar below. To measure the distance, start by butting the first point to the map and adding the next ones (one or more). You'll see the total distance on the toolbar. You can also undo or redo the steps using the arrow buttons.</p>

<p>After you've done adding points, press 'Options'. There, you can try several convenient features:</p>
<ul class="textlist">
<li><b>Snap to road</b> - this function creates a route using all your points. You can set the car, bicycle or pedestrian mode, as usual</li>
<li><b>Save as new GPX track</b> - allows you to save your editing as a set of points or a line</li>
<li><b>Add to a GPX track</b> - adds the line you've created (in a fort of straight segments) to a GPX track of your choice</li>
<li><b>Clear all</b> - removes all the points.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also measure a distance using <a href="http://osmand.net/blog?id=osmand-2-7-released">radius ruler tool</a>.</p>
