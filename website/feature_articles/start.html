<p>Also, you have to download a World basemap. It is a basic map that will later help you view the maps of the regions and countries. The free version of OsmAnd allows 7 free downloads. After the map is downloaded, please tap the 'back' button to go to the map screen.</p>
<p>The OsmAnd+ version (Android) allows unlimited downloads and map updates with all the new details. The application uses OpenStreetMap resources â€” the maps created by contributors from all over the world. People add new items to the map, refine the details and delete the points of interest (POI) that are no longer there. Thus, the updates will provide the freshest information available. To download the map of the region you need, go to <i>Download Maps - All downloads</i> and choose the one you need.</p>
<p>You can also switch to view dashboard on start. A dashboard is a starting screen with different cards containing information about different groups of settings or files. The dashboard shows your Favourites (favorite places), your GPX tracks list, the plugins information, etc. To adjust your dashboard settings, please go to OsmAnd - Dashboard and press the settings button in the right upper corner.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Ways_to_download_maps_android"><h3>For Android</h3></div>
<p>There are several ways to view maps. For offline use, you need to pre-download your maps. The OsmAnd native format is a compact vector .obf format.</p>
<p>There are two main types of maps you can download.</p>
<div class="blocksubsubtitle">Vector maps (preferred solution)</div>
<p>You can download pre-fabricated "vector" maps in OsmAnd's native format. They are very compact (about 10% compared to tiles) and allow zooming in to very high zoom levels without losing detail or resolution. If you have a relatively slow device, please note that zooming out to "overview" levels usually takes more time and CPU.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>
<p>To download the maps you need, just go to <i>OsmAnd > 'Download maps'</i> and select the country, city or region. There, you'll see all maps for this area available for downloading. The free OsmAnd version has the limit of 7 downloads (including additional voice prompts, etc.) while OsmAnd+ allows an unlimited number of downloads. You can also <a href=https://osmand.net/features/subscription>subscribe to OsmAnd Live</a>, during which you will have access to all possible functions and features of OsmAnd, including unlimited downloads of maps with hourly updates.</p>
<div class="blocksubsubtitle">Prepared maps</div>
<p>Also, you can make your own maps using <a href="http://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAndMapCreator-main.zip">OsmAnd Map Creator</a>, a tool designed for this purpose. You'll need to prepare the maps on your PC and transfer them to the "osmand" folder on your device. You might need to restart the app afterwards.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="Ways_to_download_maps_iOS"><h3>For iOS</h3></div>
<p>As you install OsmAnd iOS application, you'll be able to view and manage offline maps of virtually any country in the world. To do so, you need to tap the menu button on the left, then select Maps & Resources, choose the continent and then proceed to the map download. You can also use the Search field to find the necessary map. Besides the general map itself, you'll see a contour lines map, a Wikipedia file, a hillshade map, etc. They can be downloaded together with the main map to add layers of information. If the downloads are inactive, you'll need to turn on the contour lines plugin first. Tap <i>Maps & Resources - Plugins menu</i> and switch the plugin on. To download the map, just tap the download button next to it. As soon as the map is downloaded, tap Go to the map and start viewing the map you need. You can also start downloading other maps and view the one that's already installed while the download is in progress. Just go to the map by tapping Back.</p>

<p>OsmAnd offers you numerous map styles and data layers to fit the purpose. Let's take a glance at the main ones.</p>
<h3>Main map styles</h3>
<ul>
<li>OsmAnd style is the default style of map rendering. It offers details about the city such as streets, buildings, transport stops, etc.</li>
<li>Touring view is created to meet the needs of tourists and has higher contrast than the regular one.</li>
<li>UniRS and LightRS styles are author styles that render the basic map information but in different color schemes. May be quite useful for cyclists.</li>
<li>Nautical map style will come in handy at overwater travels: you'll see the details of infrastructure like ports, sailing routes, navigation lights, etc. <a href="http://osmand.net/features?id=nautical-charts">Read more about Nautical maps</a>.</li>
<li>Winter and ski style is designed to help you navigate on winter sports locations: you'll be able to see ski pistes and other details such as complexity of skiing tracks and ski lift markers.  <a href="http://osmand.net/features?id=ski-plugin">Read more about Ski maps</a>.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3>Online maps and layers</h3>
<p><b>For Android version</b>. You can add an over- and underlay to the basic map style you're viewing. To do that, just turn the <a href="http://osmand.net/features?id=online-maps-plugin">Online maps plugin</a> on, then go to Configure map menu and enable over-, underlay or both. Note that when you return to the main screen, you'll see a small slider allowing you to adjust the opacity of the layer and switch to the new layer completely or use it together with the base map.</p>
<p>There are tens of online layers. To install them, just go to <i>Configure map â€” Overlay (or Underlay)</i> and press Install more. Some of the maps are only available for certain regions, but others have a world coverage. You can find satellite view, cycling routes and even location of fire hydrants there. Just explore the list to find the ones you prefer. These layers require an internet connection and will be stored as raster maps in osmand/tiles folder. Please read more about the difference between raster and vector maps <a href="http://osmand.net/features?id=online-maps-plugin">here</a> .</p>
<p>You can also prepare <a href="http://osmand.net/features?id=online-maps-plugin#Prepare_raster_maps">your own raster maps</a>.</p>
