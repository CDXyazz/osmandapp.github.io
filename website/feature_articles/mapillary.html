<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_start"><h2>How to start the plugin</h2></div>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to enable the Mapillary plugin, which is available in both free and full versions of OsmAnd. Just go to OsmAnd > Plugins > Mapillary, find the three-dots button next to it and select 'Enable'. Now you can use the plugin.</p>
<p>To view the data provided by Mapillary, you will have to enable the corresponding layer on the map. Please open Configure map menu and enable 'Mapillary' option. After you return to the map, you'll see the layer of data.</p>

<p>Mapillary plugin is all about view the street imagery in OsmAnd app. To do that, just enable the plugin as described above, then zoom in till you see green dots along the streets and press any of them to view the image attached. Sometimes you can even 'move' along using the white arrows on the image. If the coverage is dense enough, you can even press 'Play' button on the image to 'take a ride' along the street.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Filtering_data"><h2>Filtering the data</h2></div>
<p>Besides viewing all Mapillary data, you can filter it to find what you need. You can filter the images by user and by time period. For example, you can view your own commits done last week. To apply a filter, please Go to Configure map menu and press on the Mapillary option. You'll see the options menu. In the 'Filter' submenu, you can enter the username and select the time period. Then press 'Apply'. Please note that you can only filter Mapillary points on 500m zoom level or closer. If the data is represented as green lines without visible separate points, that means you are at a higher zoom and won't be able to filter the points.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Adding_images"><h2>Adding images</h2></div>
<p>Let's say you decided you add an image yourself. You can do that in two ways. You can conveniently use the Mapillary plugin with the widget in the right upper corner of the map screen. To add images, just press it and you'll be redirected to the Mapillary application (you have to install it separately, for example, from Google Play).</p>

<p>Also, you can open the context menu of a certain location, scroll to the end of the images at that location, and select 'Add photos'.</p>
<p>Using the filters, you can see which streets are densely-mapped and which are not. You can also check where the data is fresh or not. After that, you can choose to avoid those roads and take the ones you'd like to add photos to instead. To do it, please build a route, then go to the context menu of the route, press the Settings button and choose Avoid roads.
