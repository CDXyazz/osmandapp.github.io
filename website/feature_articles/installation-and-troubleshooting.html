<p>If you are experiencing issues using OsmAnd, we kindly suggest that you contact OsMAnd support team at <b>support@osmand.net</b>. However, some frequent issues can be fixed with a simple reinstall of the application. It is easy. First of all, you have to backup your files. You can do it using your device's file manager or just export them from the application. If you choose the first solution, please go to OsmAnd - Settings - General settings - Data storage folder to check the path to your 'osmand' folder. Then you can copy the files to any storage you trust. To export files using OsmAnd app, just go to My places - then select 'My tracks' or 'My favorites' (you can export both), and press 'Share'. Send your favorites to an email, use Dropbox. etc. You'll be able to import files later.</p>
<p>Now you can uninstall the application. To do that, please go to your device's Settings - Apps - OsmAnd and choose 'Uninstall'. After that, install it from Google Play or Amazon, as usual. All your previous purchases will be available and you won't have to pay for them again.</p>
<div class="blocksubtitle">iOS</div>
<p>If you delete OsmAnd, all your favorites and trips will be deleted, so you have to back them up manually. To export your favorites, please go to 'My favorites' - 'Export favorite' and use the storage you trust. Now you can delete and install the app, as usual.To reinstall the app, just make a long tap on its icon and press the cross. Then go to iTunes and install it again. If it does not solve the issue, please contact us <b>support@osmand.net</b>.</p>
<p>If you use your iCloud or iTunes applications for that, please be aware that you can control the things being saved. Not only your OsmAnd data but the data used by other applications may be backed up. To make the backup, please go to Settings - iCluod - Storage - Manage storage, tap the name of your device, then find Backup options and make sure OsmAnd backup is turned on.

<p>If you have an error "-25/-26/-27" while installing the application, please try the steps described below or contact support. The issue you are experiencing is now a confirmed Xiaomi MIUI's integrated antivirus fault. To avoid error "-25/-26/-27", you need to freeze the "Guard Provider" process before updating OsmAnd. Then, once updated, you can re-enable the process. There are many ways and tools to freeze a process. We suggest you to google it yourself, although some of our users used 3C Toolbox or App Master, but we leave this to your preference.</p>
<p>To freeze a process, follow these steps: go to App Manager - Apps tab - filter by System Apps - select the "Guard Provider" - tap the Manage button (bottom right, four little squares) - Freeze. To unfreeze, repeat the same procedure. Unfortunately "App Master" does not do freeze in the OsmAnd Free version. 3C Toolbox does the trick, but you will find the "Guard Provider" process as "com.securitycore.miui_t" under "Apps" with the filter on "System".</p>
