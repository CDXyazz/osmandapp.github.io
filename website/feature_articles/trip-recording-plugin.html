<h1>OsmAnd Trip recording plugin</h1>
<p>OsmAnd Trip recording plugin is an essential tool for runners, sportsmen and tourists. It allows you to record your movement using your phone&#39;s GPS (and through other networks optionally). If you are going for a run, need to see your entire route after a walk around the city or measure the distance you covered, the plugin will help you.</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>You have to enter the Plugins menu, then select Trip recording and tap Enable. That&#39;s pretty much it. To start recording, you need to tap on the GPX widget in the right upper corner of the map screen. Also, you can choose the logging interval which determines the time between recording moments in your track. The plugin is now working. You can start your trip and see the distance you&#39;ve walked in the specific widget on the right.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an opportunity to add new waypoints to the track manually. Just tap on the location on map, choose Add GPX waypoint, name it the way you want. Then go to My Tracks dashboard menu and hit the save button. Your waypoint is added to the most recent track automatically.</p>

<h2>How to view GPX tracks</h2>
<p>You can view your GPX tracks in OsmAnd or in other software. Also, the track itself can be created by you or imported from an external source. For instance, from <a href="http://openstreetmap.org"> openstreetmap.org</a>, your local hiking forum or any other place.</p>
<p>To view it in OsmAnd, go to the Dashboard  - My tracks and tap 'Show on map' on those you'd like to see.</p>
<p>To view it in Google Earth, go to File > Open > file type GPS (*.gpx, . . .) Navigate to your track and open.</p>
<p><b>View OsmAnd GPX tracks in Garmin software</b></p>
<p>Because OsmAnd GPX format differs from the Garmin one, you will need to convert your OsmAnd track into the Garmin format.</p>
<p>Download and install GPSBabel from gpsbabel.org</p>
<p>To be safe, make a copy of the GPX file to work with.</p>
<p>Open GPSBabel and use the following settings:</p>
<ul type="disc">
        <li>Input format: "GPX XML"</li>
        <li>Source file: Copied file as discussed above</li>
        <li>Output format: "Garmin MapSource - gdb"</li>
        <li>Output file same name as input file (i.e. overwrite source - Answer Yes when prompted to over-write)</li>
    <li>Run GPSBabel ("Apply" button). If the translation has worked the log screen will say "Translation successful"</li>
</ul>
<p>Open the converted file in Garmin software (!MapSource, !BaseCamp) in your usual way.</p>

<p><b>View (and edit/convert) OsmAnd GPX tracks in RouteConverter</p></b>

Download RouteConverter from <a href="https://routeconverter.de">routeconverter.de</a>.

<p>Take OsmAnd Trip recording plugin with you on your trip to make an informative track.</p>
<b>CAUTION</b> Recording a track impacts the battery life: even if the screen is off, it continues to run. Check it using the notification that OsmAnd is running in the background in your status bar. 
<p>Increasing battery life</p>
<p>Hint: Before putting the device to sleep mode on a long hike, press the home button so the OsmAnd app goes to the background. If OsmAnd remains in the foreground and the device is often turned on even briefly (maybe even accidentally, like by shifting in your pocket or backpack), then GPS would be activated each time with very noticeable impact on you battery life. In remote areas with bad or no cell reception, you can also set the device to "Flight mode" (but with GPS on) to save the battery by preventing the cell phone using high transmission power to look for transmission towers. You can get good 20 hours of recording GPX tracks on hikes with the above parameters.</p>
