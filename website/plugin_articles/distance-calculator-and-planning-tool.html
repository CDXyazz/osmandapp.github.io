<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>If you just want to measure the distance between two or more points, hit the widget in the upper right corner of the map and choose Start editing. You can add point to the map by tapping on it. You&#39;ll see the orange line between the waypoints - that&#39;s the distance calculated. Please note that it is not a route, it does not take streets and other objects to account. It is the same as a simple ruler: you measure the shortest distance between two points. If you can't see the widget, please reload the application.</p>
<p>When you'll add the second point to your measurments, you'll see the distance between them in the widget. As you add other points, you'll see the entire distance of the line.</p>

<h2>Create or edit GPX track</h2>
<p>You can also export the points you&#39;ve added as a GPX file. Just tap the widget once you add all the points, then choose Save as GPX track and name it. You&#39;ll see your new track in the Tracks list at the dashboard. To view it, simply tap on the track and choose Show on map. To see the information about the waypoint including the speed at a certain point, just make a long tap on the waypoint.</p>
<p>You can also choose Open existing GPX to edit a GPX track.</p>

<b>CAUTION</b> Recording a track impacts the battery life: even if the screen is off, it continues to run. Check it using the notification that OsmAnd is running in the background in your status bar. 
Increasing battery life
Hint: Before putting the device to sleep mode on a long hike, press the home button so the OsmAnd app goes to the background. If OsmAnd remains in the foreground and the device is often turned on even briefly (maybe even accidentally, like by shifting in your pocket or backpack), then GPS would be activated each time with very noticeable impact on you battery life. In remote areas with bad or no cell reception, you can also set the device to "Flight mode" (but with GPS on) to save the battery by preventing the cell phone using high transmission power to look for transmission towers. You can get good 20 hours of recording GPX tracks on hikes with the above parameters.
