<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>If you just want to measure the distance between two or more points, hit the widget in the upper right corner of the map and choose Start editing. You can add point to the map by tapping on it. You'll see the orange line between the waypoints - thatâ€™s the distance calculated. Please note that it is not a route, it does not take streets and other objects to account. It is the same as a simple ruler: you measure the shortest distance between two points.</p>
