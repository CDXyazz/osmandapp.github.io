<div class="centerimageblog">
<p>To see the contours of a specific area, just go to map downloads, choose Contour lines in the upper menu bar (it is set to Regular maps by default) and get the region you need. Then zoom your desired area until you see the lines and zoom even more to check the height of a specific spot (the number on the line).</p>
<p>To see the visualization of a terrain, make sure you download the corresponding section of the map (switch to Hillshade overlay in the All downloads menu) and enable Hillshade in your map configurations, then relaunch the app.</p>
<p>After that, you&#39;ll be able to enjoy a map with all the hills and peaks. A nice option for both practical use and a general knowledge about the area you live in or travel to.</p>

ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems).</p>
